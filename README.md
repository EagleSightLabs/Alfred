# A.L.F.R.E.D.
A.L.F.R.E.D. stands for Artificial Learning and Functional Reasoning Enabled Device.

## Inspiration:
Inspired by the MCU and Iron Man movies A.L.F.R.E.D. I wanted to create my own AI personal assistant. I've never done anything like this before so only time will tell how this project goes.

## Goals
A.L.F.R.E.D. is meant to serve as an AI assistant for the tech enthusiast. What does that mean? That means I want A.L.F.R.E.D. to be built upon open LLM's (Large Languge Models) so that it can be run in your own computer or homelab without the need for a cloud archictecture to run it. Additionally I'd like it to be able to integrate with Git whether that's a local Git or GitHub itself. This way you can ask A.L.F.R.E.D. to create a project and it can go and create the code repo as well as write all the code for your project saving you time and energy. I'd also like for it to integrate with services such as OpenWeatherMap and HomeAssistant so that it can help you in your day to day life.

AS I mentioned in the inspiration section above I've never built anything like this so only time will tell how this project evolves. This will be a long term project that and not something you can expect to have working in a short period of time unless we get multiple contributors to the project.
